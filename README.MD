will update this readme soon


this library is a build the esp32 BLE Library to use the CYD Screens to give the screen the functionality of a remote bluetooth button system that sends shortcuts to the OS its connected to. not all features are fully tested so user warning is advised until its fully tested. each .ino file has a different system of buttons for example P1 is General shortcuts, P2 is firefox shortcuts, p3 is arduino ide, p4 is vs code and p5 is youtube shortcuts. my goal is to integrate 5 pages in the .ino file but there are more bugs to work out for that.
