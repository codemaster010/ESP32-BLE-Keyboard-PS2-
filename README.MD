ESP32-BLE-Keyboard library with ESP32 Cheap Yellow Display Board â€“ CYD (ESP32-2432S028R)

* Button color change with touch
* Fast access to valuable shorcuts
* Ble Connection to Raspberry Pi, Android and Windows (Not fully tested)
* Easy to read button labels can edit in the array
* Multiple functions to perform shorcuts
* Easy to load in arduino Ide
* Page top labels

  
To do, WIP: integrate 5 pages, navigation and correct shortcuts/functions into one .ino file.

this library is a build of the esp32 BLE Library to use the CYD 2.8 inch Screen to give the screen the functionality of a remote bluetooth button system that sends shortcuts to the OS its connected to. not all features are fully tested so user warning is advised until its fully tested. each .ino file has a different system of buttons for example P1 is General shortcuts, P2 is firefox shortcuts, p3 is arduino ide, p4 is vs code and p5 is youtube shortcuts. my goal is to integrate 5 pages in the .ino file but there are more bugs to work out for that.
